# js-data-structures
A series of commonly used data structures implemented in JavaScript. 

Go to https://rawgit.com/moczka/js-data-structures/master/index.html
and open your DevTools, the data structure constructors are namespaced with “DataStructure” to the global context.

So to create a Map for example do: var map = DataStructure.Map();
